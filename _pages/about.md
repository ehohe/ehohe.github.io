I study the social psychology of political communication and am interested broadly in how everyday Americans navigate political discourse. My work addresses challenges of answering this question at two levels. At the macro level, I examine conceptual and measurement issues involving how individuals conceptualize politics, interpret democratic norms, and structure different political identities. At the micro level, I’m interested in the mechanisms and outcomes of peer to peer interaction including persuasion, metaperceptions, and how people actually talk about politics. In my dissertation I bridge these levels and investigate how people strategically adapt how they discuss politics to overcome polarized political differences in the face of flexible group norms.
